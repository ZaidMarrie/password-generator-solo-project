# Password Generator (Solo Project Solution)

This is my solution to the [Password Generator Solo Project on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript/solo-project-password-generator-cR9B46Sg). The solo projects are part of the [Scrimba Platform's Courses](https://scrimba.com/allcourses).

## Overview

### The challenge

You are required to do the following:

- Build the site from scratch
- Follow the design

The following is not required, but they are some stretch goals to take this project further:

- Add ability to set password length.
- Add "copy-on-click" feature.
- Toggle "symbols" and "numbers" on/off.
